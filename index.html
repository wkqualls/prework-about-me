      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm currently a student, but also work remotely parttime for a statistical analytics firm.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Campton Hills, one of the far west suburbs of Chicago, but lived in Midland Michigan for about four years too.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm choosing some new hobbies for myself lately, like boxing, wrestling, food blogging, playing the harmonica, and maybe some voice work. I also enjoy reading, writing, walks on the beach, music (especially Counting Crows), and some gaming.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm still deciding for myself, but the current sketch in something in data science.  This course is a means to that end.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>My sweet home, Chicago. Specifically Logan Square, near Hermosa.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm the pragmatic sort. I believe I can be good at it, I find it interesting enough to enjoy, I like opportunities to get creative with what I do, it pays well, and it has a variety of career tracks that I could choose as I gain experience.</p>
